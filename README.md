# 👋 Hi there, I'm Julien!

## 🎓 About me
I am a second-year student of B.U.T. degree in Computer science, taking the courses of application realization at the IUT Lyon 1.

When I am not coding, I enjoy some physical activities such as cycling 🚴‍♂️, archery 🏹, and walking 🚶‍♂️.

I also like to play video games and enjoy music while walking and enjoying the landscapes. 🎵

I am a big fan of Object-Oriented Programming and I enjoy solving coding problems on platforms like Codingame. I also like to participate in Clash of Codes on Codingame. 😄

Thank you for taking the time to read about me. Feel free to connect with me on Github and let's code together! 😄
